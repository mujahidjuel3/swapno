            <p>21.1. Except where indicated otherwise, the listed or suggested price for products on Shwapno.com reflects the full retail price as suggested by the products manufacturer or supplier, or estimated based on standard industry practices. It might also represent the estimated retail value compared to similarly featured items available elsewhere. These prices serve as comparative estimates and may not always reflect the current market price in every area on any given day.</p>
            <p>21.2. We strive for accuracy in all our listed prices, but a small number of items in our catalog might be incorrectly priced due to technical or human errors. Should the Market Retail Price (MRP) of an item be higher than the price we have listed, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to either contact you for further instructions before dispatching the item or to cancel your order and notify you of the cancellation.</p>
            <p>21.3. Conversely, if the MRP of a product is lower than the price listed on Shwapno.com, upon being informed, we will either process a refund for the difference or replace the product as per your preference.</p>
